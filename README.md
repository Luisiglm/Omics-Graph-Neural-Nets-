# Omics-Graph-Neural-Nets-
Here we provide an implementation of graph neural networks for multi-omics data using TensorFlow. 
##The Repository has the following components:
###data/ A folder with the data from the TCGA consortium, dowloaded from Firehose and the Adjacency matrix from Reactome. 
###layers/ The implementation of different graph neural networks layers for multi omics data. 
###models/ Our implementation of neural networks models with graph neural networks. 
###preprocessing/ Functions to read and pre-process the data. 
###run/  Scripts to train and evaluate the graph neural networks models.
