# Omics-Graph-Neural-Nets-
Here we provide an implementation of graph neural networks for multi-omics data using TensorFlow. 
 ###### The Repository has the following components:
-[x]data/ A folder with the data from the TCGA consortium, dowloaded from Firehose and the Adjacency matrix from Reactome. 
-[x]layers/ The implementation of different graph neural networks layers for multi omics data. 
-[x]models/ Our implementation of neural networks models with graph neural networks. 
-[x]preprocessing/ Functions to read and pre-process the data. 
-[]run/  Scripts to train and evaluate the graph neural networks models.
 ###### Dependencies
 Our implementation requires Python 3.6 or superior, plus the following libraries:
 .- Tensorflow
 .- numpy
